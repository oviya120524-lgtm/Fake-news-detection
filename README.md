# Fake-news-detection
Fake news detection is the process of identifying and preventing the spread of false or misleading information, particularly on digital platforms like social media, websites, and news outlets. 
It combines techniques from natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and data analysis to evaluate the credibility of news articles or posts. The process involves analyzing text for linguistic 
patterns, sensational language, source credibility, and factual consistency. Machine learning models are trained on labeled datasets containing real and fake news to learn how to differentiate between them. 
These models can be supervised or unsupervised and may also use deep learning approaches like neural networks for more accurate results. In addition to automated systems, human fact-checkers play a crucial
role in verifying claims and curbing misinformation. Detecting fake news is essential to protect public opinion, maintain trust in media, and prevent the social and political harm that false information can cause.
